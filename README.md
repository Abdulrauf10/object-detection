A lightweight, browser-based object detection app using your webcam and the power of TensorFlow.js. Built with Next, powered by real-time machine learning.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
How might we make computer vision and object detection more accessible, portable, and intuitive—without requiring heavy native apps?

## 💡 Solution
This project allows anyone with a web browser and a camera to:

Detect objects in real time

See bounding boxes and labels around recognized items

All powered by TensorFlow.js running 100% client-side.
